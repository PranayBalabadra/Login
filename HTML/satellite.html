It was developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into sun-synchronous orbits, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV in 1993, only commercially available from Russia. PSLV can also launch small size satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).[11]')">

During the initial years from the initial launch to 2014 the launcher had a checkered history with only 2 successful launches out of 7.')">
